**On A Budget is a simple Google spreadsheet to track your expenses, incomes
and budgets. That's it. Only what you need, carefully designed by people who
needed the same tool than you while still controlling it entirely. It saves you
the hassle of searching for apps or resources and let you start now to grow
your finance.**
